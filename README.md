Frontend: React.js (with Vite) + Tailwind CSS for a dynamic, responsive UI.
Backend: Django (Python) with RESTful APIs for secure, scalable operations.
Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS for robust data storage and geospatial queries.
Authentication: JWT for role-based access (Student, Landlord, Admin).
Storage: AWS S3 for secure image and document hosting.
APIs: Google Maps API for mapping; Elasticsearch for real-time search.
Tools: BeautifulSoup (data scraping), Requests (API calls), Redis (caching).
Deployment: AWS (EC2, RDS) with Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.

⚠️ Challenges & Mitigations
Challenges

Listing Accuracy: Outdated or fraudulent listings pose risks.
Security: Protecting user data in messaging and document uploads.
Scalability: Handling traffic spikes at semester starts.

Mitigations

Automated verification and spam detection for listings.
End-to-end encryption and role-based access control (RBAC).
Database optimization with indexing and Redis caching.
Legal consultation to ensure compliance with housing policies.


📚 Lessons Learned

API Design: Early endpoint planning minimized integration issues.
Collaboration: Weekly syncs and GitHub streamlined teamwork.
Tech Stack: React’s Virtual DOM and Django’s ORM accelerated development, though debugging required precision.


🔮 Future Enhancements

Introduce real-time chat and push notifications.
Add email verification and two-factor authentication.
Scale with database sharding and load balancing.
Enhance UI with interactive hover effects and loading states.
Implement end-to-end encryption for messages and documents.
